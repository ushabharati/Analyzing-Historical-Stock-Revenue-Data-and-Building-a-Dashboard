# Analyzing-Historical-Stock-Revenue-Data-and-Building-a-Dashboard with Python
Extracting the revenue data for Tesla and GameStop and build a dashboard using Python to compare the price of the stock vs the revenue.

## Overview

Welcome to the Stock Investment Dashboard Project! This project focuses on extracting and visualizing financial data like historical share price and quarterly revenue reportings from various sources for popular stocks: Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), and GameStop (GME). I will assume the role of Data Scientist/Data Analyst working for a new startup investment firm that helps customers invest their money in stocks. I have utilized Python libraries and web scraping techniques to gather historical stock prices and quarterly revenue reports. After collecting this data I visualized it in a dashboard to identify patterns or trends. 

## Dashboard Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) by extracting and visualizing stock data using Plotly. I have used Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio to access and display financial data in an interactive dashboard, gaining hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization.
