## ðŸ“ˆ Stock Investment Dashboard Project

## ðŸš€ Overview

Welcome to the Stock Investment Dashboard Project! This project focuses on extracting and visualizing financial data, such as historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, for popular stocks: Tesla (TSLA), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), and GameStop (GME). As a Data Scientist / Data Analyst at a new startup investment firm, I helped customers invest by analyzing stock performance. I used Python libraries and web scraping techniques to gather historical stock prices and quarterly revenue reports. After collecting the data, I visualized it in an interactive dashboard to identify patterns and trends.

## ðŸ“Š Dashboard Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing key performance indicators (KPIs) by extracting and visualizing stock data using Plotly. I used Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio to access and display financial data in an interactive dashboard, gaining hands-on experience in data analysis and visualization.
